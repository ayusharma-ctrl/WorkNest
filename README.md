## Overview

**WorkNest** is a task management and collaboration tool that allows users to:
- Sign up and create their first project.
- Invite teammates and assign different roles.
- Create and manage tasks with deadlines, tags, and statuses.
- Collaborate using a drag-and-drop interface for easy task updates.
- Manage projects with strict access controls ensuring that each projectâ€™s data is isolated and secure.

The app is built using modern technologies, leveraging the T3 stack, and is deployed on AWS via SST, utilizing services like AWS Lambda (Edge functions), S3, CloudFront, and CloudWatch.

Before deploying, ensure your **AWS credentials** are properly configured. Follow the guide here:  
ðŸ”— [Configure AWS IAM Credentials](https://sst.dev/docs/iam-credentials#credentials)

Once configured, deploy with:

```bash
npx sst deploy --stage production
```


## Setting up the new T3 Stack from Scratch

```bash
npm create t3-app@latest
```

## Select the Following Configuration

- **Project Name:** AppName
- **Language:** TypeScript
- **Styling:** Tailwind CSS
- **API:** tRPC
- **Authentication:** NextAuth.js
- **ORM:** Prisma
- **Router:** Choose the classic pages or Next.js App Router as required

## Setting up SST for AWS Deployment

### Install SST CLI

```bash
npm create sst

```

### Note for Windows Users: 
#### If you encounter issues, use:

```bash
npm install sst@two --save-exact

```

## Deployment

### Configure AWS IAM Credentials

1. Create an IAM user in your AWS account.
2. Generate an **Access Key** and **Secret**.
3. Follow the [SST IAM Credentials Guide](https://sst.dev/docs/iam-credentials/) to properly configure your environment.
4. Create an **IAM group**, add your user to the group, create a **policy** for the group, and attach the policy.

### Deploy Your Application

```bash
npm run deploy
```

This command is equivalent to running:

```bash
sst deploy --stage production
```

### Environment Variables
Create a .env file in the root directory with the following keys or follow .env.example file:

```bash
AUTH_SECRET=your_secret
NEXTAUTH_URL=your_server_url
DATABASE_URL=your_postgresql_connection_string
AUTH_GITHUB_ID=your_github_client_id
AUTH_GITHUB_SECRET=your_github_client_secret
AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID=your_aws_access_key
AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY=your_aws_secret_key

```

You also need to save these to github repository if you have plans to setup CI/CD using Github Actions.

# Known Issues

## SST on Windows:
- SST may have limited support on native Windows environments. It is recommended to use Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL) if you encounter issues.
